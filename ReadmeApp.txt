React Native Map-Based Area Calculator
Overview
This project is a React Native application that allows users to draw polygons on a map, calculate their areas, and store the coordinates along with the calculated area. It also features the ability to display the current location on the map.

Features
Draw a polygon on the map by tapping.
Calculate the area of the drawn polygon in acres.
Save polygon boundaries and their areas for later viewing.
Display the current location on the map.
Clear the map and reset the drawing.
Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)
React Native CLI
Android Studio or Xcode (for iOS)
A working emulator (Android or iOS) or a physical device.
Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-native-map-app.git
cd react-native-map-app
2. Install the dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
or if you use Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
3. Link Native Dependencies
Since the app uses native modules, you need to link them. Use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx react-native link
4. Set up Google Maps API
You need to set up an API key for Google Maps to work. Follow the instructions below:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a project.
Enable Maps SDK for Android and Maps SDK for iOS.
Get the API key.
Now, add your API key to the project:

For Android: Open android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and add the following line inside the <application> tag:

xml
Copy code
<meta-data
  android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
  android:value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"/>
For iOS: Open ios/AppName/AppDelegate.m and add the following line:

objc
Copy code
[GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"];
5. Permissions for Location Access
For Android, open android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and ensure that the following permissions are present:

xml
Copy code
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
For iOS, open ios/AppName/Info.plist and add the following keys:

xml
Copy code
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your location to show it on the map.</string>
6. Running the App
You can now run the app on an emulator or physical device. Make sure your emulator or device is running, and then execute the following command:

For Android:

bash
Copy code
npx react-native run-android
For iOS (requires macOS):

bash
Copy code
npx react-native run-ios
7. Using the App
When the app opens, you'll see a map (satellite view).
Tap anywhere on the map to start drawing a polygon. Continue tapping to add more points.
Click the "Calculate Area" button to calculate the area of the drawn polygon.
Click "Clear" to remove the polygon and reset the map.
Click "View Saved Polygons" to view previously saved polygons with their area.
Click "Show Current Location" to display your current GPS location on the map.

Dependencies
The project uses the following key dependencies:

react-native-maps: For displaying Google Maps.
geolib: For calculating the area of polygons.
react-native-permissions: For handling location permissions.
react-native-location: For retrieving the current location.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Map not displaying: Make sure that your Google Maps API key is correctly configured.
Location permission denied: Ensure the location permissions are set up correctly in AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist.
App crash on startup: Check if all dependencies are installed and linked properly using npx react-native link.

Tips for the Interview:
Explain each step clearly: During the interview, explain how you set up the project, particularly how you integrated Google Maps and handled permissions.
Highlight your problem-solving skills: If you faced any challenges (like location permissions, rendering issues, etc.), explain how you resolved them.
Mention improvements or scalability: Discuss any additional features you could implement, such as saving polygons to a backend or improving performance when drawing larger shapes.
Let me know if you need any more adjustments!
